                                    <p><b> What are DEF CON Groups?</b></p>
                                    <p>The DEF CON Groups were spawned from the annual DEF CON security conference in Las Vegas. The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker culture and it's members.</p>

				     <p><b> When/Where do we meet?</b></p>
                                    <p>When: Every last Wednesday 6:30 PM Where: 735 Seibert Rd #4, Scott AFB, IL 62225</p>

				     <p><b>Is this a hacker meeting?</b></p>
                                    <p>No, this is something better. Anything with the 'hacker' label on it tends attract only one kind of person. This meeting is designed to attract not only hackers but members of the InfoSec community and people who want to learn more about InfoSec but do not consider themselves hackers. The purpose here is to interact with people who may have different backgrounds but share the same passion for technology. Many security people feel that hackers are nothing but trouble and many hackers feel that security people are clueless. Those generalizations are often made in error and we'd like to bring all techno-dweebs back under a single umbrella.</p>

                                   <p><b>Are skript kids, lamers, and n00bs welcome?</b></p>
                                    <p>Yes, but with caveats. Some meetings and groups try to exclude those they consider to be lame, unskilled, or just simply new. Most folks do so because they want to forget that at one point, they themselves were new/unskilled too. The DCGs are more than happy to have these folks, provided they are there to learn a few things and have a desire to increase their skill. If you are content being a script kid, a lamer, or a n00b, feel free to attend but try not to be disruptive of those there to learn new things. As the quote says 'Ignorance is forgivable, because it's curable; stupidity is not... The difference between ignorance and stupidity is in the desire to remain ignorant'. Being a hacker is about wanting to evolve quicker than the masses, so we encourage you to take advantage of every opportunity to do so.</p>

				     <p><b>Does Illegal Activity happen at these meetings?/b></p>
                                    <p>DEF CON does not condone illegal activity, and neither do the DCGs.</p>
				    
				     <p><b>I'm with law enforcement or the media, can I come?</b></p>
                                    <p>Sure, just be open with people about who you are and what you do. This helps us to get on an even ground and avoid any misunderstandings. In fact, if you could drop an email to the local DC-Group point of contact ahead of time we would appreciate it. Failure to disclose who you are might lead to the perception that you're out to "get someone". You already know who we are, we expect the same information from you.
